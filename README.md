# Vim_settings

Some personal settings for [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) and [neovim](https://neovim.io/).

Improvements shall be implemented to run as Python IDE and LaTeX document editor.

Credits for [Lervag](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex) and [Junnegunn Choi](https://github.com/junegunn) who supported and inspired these configs.
